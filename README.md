# MY_LIBC
Personnal library for my EPITECH C projects. It aims to reproduce some functions from the standard libC (and add some others).

## Installation
First, clone the repository at the root of your project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/inkurey-22/my_libc.git
```

Then, move the `my.h` file to your `include/` directory, and the `my/` in your `lib/`.

Finally, call my Makefile with yours in the needed rules.

## Usage
Simply include the `my.h` file in your C files, and call the functions you need.
